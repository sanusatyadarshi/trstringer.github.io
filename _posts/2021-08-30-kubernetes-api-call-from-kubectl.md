title: Get Kubernetes API Calls from kubectl

tags: [kubernetes]

It's a rare occurrence, but there may be a time when you need to make a direct call to the Kubernetes API server to do something. Or maybe you are just curious about the REST API and what's happening under the covers!

The Kubernetes docs do a great job on showing the first step [how to get the token and curl the API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api/#without-kubectl-proxy), but how do you start discovering the different API calls for different operations?

The answer is through `kubectl`. Add verbose logging level of 8+ and you will get the API calls!

Let's see this in action. Say you want to get the Kubernetes API call to get all of the pods in the default namespace:

```
$ kubectl get pods -v=8
```

The output contains a *lot* of information:

```

```

We see a lot of interesting things here, but we are curious about the API call which we can find on the second line. So now we know the API call to get all pods in the `default` namespace is a `GET` on `api/v1/namespaces/default/pods`.

Let's see another example: Find all services in the cluster with the label `component=apiserver`.

```
$ kubectl get services --all-namespaces -l component=apiserver -v=8
```

Looking through the output we can see that the API call is a `GET` on `api/v1/services?labelSelector=component%3Dapiserver`.

What about if you want to create or modify a Kubernetes resource? You can still do the same thing as above, but there's a good chance you don't want kubectl doing the creation or modification. You might just want kubectl to tell you the API call, but don't do it. We can add the parameter `--dry-run=server` to get this information *without* modifying anything!

Another example: Find out the API call to create a namespace, without creating the namespace.

```
$ kubectl create namespace test --dry-run=server -v=8
```

We can see with the output that it is a `POST` on `api/v1/namespaces` with the request body of `{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Namespace","metadata":{"creationTimestamp":null,"name":"test"},"spec":{},"status":{}}`.

And since this was a dry run, the namespace wasn't created.

Hopefully this blog post has showed you a quick and easy way to get the Kubernetes API calls for any operation you can run through kubectl!
